# Snake Game with AI


## Commands

#### Start manual game
```python
    python main.py
```

#### Start AI game
```python
    python main.py --ai-mode
```

#### Start AI game for training model
```python
    python main.py --ai-mode --train

Firstly, we need to start the training of model and 
then after ~200 game iterations we can start trained model.
**Without training model will be raw and stupid so don't skip training step!**
